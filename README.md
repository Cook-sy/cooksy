# Cooksy

## Getting started
To get started with development, clone the repo and run the following commands:
- Clone the repo
- `cd cooksy`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

The `npm start` command will start up two servers. It will start up the backend server which is found at `http://localhost:3001`. The second server is for the frontend which is found at `http://localhost:3000`.

To develop on the frontend, navigate to the `client` directory in a separate terminal (`cd client`), and run the commands:
- `npm install`
- `npm test`

The tests will be run in an interactive/watch mode.
